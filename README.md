# Interview Cake Challenges

This repository is a personal collection of coding challenges from [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/).  
This repository is not about providing perfect or optimized solutions. Instead, the goal is to practice problem-solving and algorithmic thinking by working through the exercises step by step.

## Structure

Each challenge has its own folder containing:

- **`challenge.md`** – the original problem statement (copied from Interview Cake)
- **`index.js`** – my solution attempt in JavaScript
